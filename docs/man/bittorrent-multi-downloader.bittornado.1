.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the \fBbtlaunchmany\fP and 
\fBbtlaunchmanycurses\fP commands.
This manual page was written for the Debian distribution
because the original program does not have a manual page.
.PP
\fBbtlaunchmany\fP is a program that eases the use of 
bittorrent in multiple-downloader situations.  The program checks
a directory for torrent files.  When it finds any, it starts a 
separate downloader thread for each file.
.SH OPTIONS

These programs have the exact same options as the normal 
downloaders, which are documented in \fBbittorrent-downloader\fP(1).
