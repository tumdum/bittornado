.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBbttrack\fP \fIurl\fP \fIoldtorrent\fP \fInewtorrent\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the \fBbtreannounce\fP
command.
This manual page was written for the Debian distribution
because the original program does not have a manual page.
.PP
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics, 
.\" respectively.
\fBbtreannounce\fP is a program which will change the announce 
address of a existing torrent file.  The torrent specified by 
the \fIoldtorrent\fP argument will be modified to use the new 
announce url given by the \fIurl\fP argument, and the changed 
file will be saved as \fInewtorrent\fP.
