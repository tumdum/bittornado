.SH NAME
btrename \- change the suggested filename inside a bittorrent file
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBbttrack\fP \fItorrent\fP \fInewfilename\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the \fBbtrename\fP
command.
This manual page was written for the Debian distribution
because the original program does not have a manual page.
.PP
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics, 
.\" respectively.
\fBbtrename\fP is a program which will change the suggested 
filename presented to the user for a bittorrent file. This 
will make the downloader save it as a different name by default.
The torrent specified by the \fItorrent\fP option is modified 
in-place, changing the suggested filename to \fInewfilename\fP.
